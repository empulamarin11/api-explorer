Functional:
01: A user can register and log in.
02: Once logged in, the user sees a screen with a search box.
03: When searching, the app consumes an external API (we'll start with the Pok√©API) and displays the results in cards.
04: The app keeps a record of which user searched for what and when.

Non-functional:
01: The intuitive interface
02: The architecture should be modular (separate frontend, backend, and database) to facilitate future changes.
03: Deployment should be simple using Docker.
